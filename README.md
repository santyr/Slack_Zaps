# Slack Zaps: Nostr Zaps for the Slack Workspace

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)](https://github.com)

A powerful, deeply integrated Slack application that allows users to send and receive instant, fee-less Bitcoin Lightning "zaps" as a form of appreciation and reward.

This project leverages a centralized [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits) instance to create a seamless user experience, making the act of showing appreciation as easy as reacting with an emoji.

## Vision & Philosophy

The goal is to foster a culture of recognition by removing all friction from peer-to-peer value transfer. Our philosophy is guided by two principles:

1.  **Context and Choice:** Meet users where they are. A user should be able to send a zap from anywhere they think of doing it‚Äîreacting to a message, looking at a user's profile, or firing off a command.
2.  **Instant and Free:** By using a single LNbits instance for internal ledger updates, all transactions are instantaneous and incur zero network fees.

## Core Features

-   ‚ö° **Four Ways to Zap:** Use `/zap`, a message shortcut, the App Home GUI, or a button on a user's profile.
-   üè¶ **Centralized LNbits Backend:** All payments are instant and fee-less internal transfers.
-   ‚ú® **Seamless Onboarding:** A guided `/zap-setup` command creates or links a wallet and automatically updates the user's Slack profile.
-   üè† **App Home Dashboard:** A central hub to view your balance, see transaction history, and top up your wallet.
-   üîó **Custom Profile Integration:** Onboard by editing your profile and zap users directly from their profile pop-up.
-   üß† **Smart Notifications:** The app intelligently invites new users and can aggregate multiple zaps into a single notification thread to reduce noise.

## The User Journey

### 1. One-Time Admin Setup

Before the app can be used, a Slack Workspace Admin must perform a crucial one-time setup:

1.  Navigate to **Workspace Settings > Customize > People > Profile fields**.
2.  Click **"Add field"**.
3.  Create a `Text` field named **"LNbits Read Key"** (or similar).
4.  **Important:** Note the **Field ID** that Slack generates (e.g., `Xf0...`). You will need this for the `.env` configuration file.

### 2. Onboarding a New User

The user experience begins with a simple, guided setup process.

1.  **Initiation:** The user types the `/zap-setup` command.
2.  **Choice:** The app presents a private, interactive choice: **[ Create a New Wallet ]** or **[ Link an Existing Wallet ]**.
3.  **Backend Magic:**
    -   The backend creates or validates the user's LNbits wallet via the core LNbits API.
    -   It securely stores the mapping of `Slack User ID` -> `LNbits Wallet Key` in its encrypted database.
    -   It then uses the Slack API to **write the LNbits Read Key into the custom profile field** created by the admin.
4.  **Completion:** The user is notified that their setup is complete.

### 3. Sending a Zap: The Four Methods

Once onboarded, users have four intuitive ways to send a zap.

| Method             | User Action                                                   | Use Case & Advantage                                                                                          |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Slash Command**  | `/zap @user <amt> <msg>`                                      | **Speed & Power.** Ideal for power users and for sending zaps not tied to a specific message.                 |
| **Message Shortcut**| Hover on message `(...)` -> `‚ö°Ô∏è Zap this message`            | **Context.** The most intuitive way to reward valuable content. The notification appears in the message's thread. |
| **App Home GUI**   | Go to App Home -> Click `[Send a Zap]`                        | **Visual.** Perfect for users who prefer a graphical interface over commands.                                 |
| **Profile GUI**    | Click a user's profile -> `View details in App` -> `[‚ö°Ô∏è Zap User]` | **Discoverability.** The most native-feeling method, allowing users to zap directly from a profile card.        |

## The App Home: Your Central Dashboard

The App Home tab is the user's central hub for all zap-related activity. It features:

-   **Live Balance:** Displays the current LNbits wallet balance in sats.
-   **Send a Zap Button:** The primary call-to-action for the GUI zap flow.
-   **Recent Transactions:** A list of the latest zaps sent and received.
-   **Top Up Wallet Button:** Generates a new Lightning invoice from the user's wallet for easy funding.
-   **Manage Wallet Link:** A direct link to the user's wallet on the LNbits web interface.

## Technical Architecture

The system consists of three distinct components:

1.  **Slack App:** Built with a framework like **Bolt for Python/JS**. Manages all user-facing interactions (modals, commands, shortcuts).
2.  **Backend Service:** A web service (e.g., **FastAPI**, **Express**) that contains all business logic. It communicates with both Slack and LNbits and stores user mappings in an encrypted database.
3.  **Central LNbits Instance:** A single, self-hosted or managed LNbits server that acts as the ledger for all internal transactions. The backend communicates with it via the core LNbits API (specifically `POST /api/v1/users` for wallet creation).

## Installation & Configuration

### Prerequisites

-   A running LNbits instance with its URL and Admin API Key.
-   A Slack Workspace where you have administrative privileges.

## Security Considerations

-   **Database Encryption:** The database storing the `Slack ID <-> LNbits Key` mapping MUST be encrypted at rest.
-   **Environment Variables:** Never commit the `.env` file to version control. Use a secrets management system for production.
-   **Request Verification:** The backend must verify the cryptographic signature of all incoming requests from Slack to prevent forged requests.
-   **API Key Scopes:** The LNbits Admin Key is highly sensitive. Ensure it is stored securely and network access to your LNbits instance is restricted.

## Roadmap & Contributing

This project provides a robust foundation. Pull requests are welcome! Future enhancements could include:

-   [ ] **Aggregated Notifications:** Bundle multiple zaps on a single message into one updating notification.
